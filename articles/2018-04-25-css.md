Call HTML elements in css easily. To make all h1 elements blue,

```css 
h1 {
    color: blue
}
```

To distinguish between elements on a page, you must use selectors- ids and classes. Use ids if you have just one instance that you want to change the style of; use classes when you have more than one example. 

Also, an element only has 1 id, but can have multiple classes

Say in you homepage, you might have

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css">
        <script src='js'></script>
    </head>
    <body id='home'>
        Content here
        <h2 class='modified'>Heading</h2>
        ...
        <h2 class='modified'>Another heading</h2>
    </body
```

### Box Model

- Padding/margin

Padding goes in between the element and its border, while margin lies outside 
the border.
