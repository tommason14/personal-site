# MChem project

## Main Aims

- Prove that urea-terminated polymers exhibit self-healing

- Need the material. Use lesser amounts of EHA and HMDI! \[3 days to see if works- START MONDAY\]
	- Di
	- 5 mol% tri
	- 10 mol% tri
- Sulfur compounds have been found to the exhibit self-healing proprties, very
  common in literature, so we can compare the urea-modified polymers with
  thiourea-modified versions. Maybe thiolate the [hydroxy pTHF](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1993/p1/p19930001113#!divAbstract) before reacting for a truly sulfonated polymer?
- Need to make the thiourea-modified polymer. Two options:
	1. Take the urea-modified polymer and perform thionation of all the
	   carbonyl groups present. \[2 days?\]
	2. 'Thionate' prior to EHA addition. \[2 days?\]

## Questions to answer

- How to use LR? Conditions, solvent, removing byproducts (purification),
  [safety](http://www.apolloscientific.co.uk/downloads/msds/OR5755_msds.pdf) aspects (bleach immediately to remove smell). \[1 day\]
	- _NB: No contact with water- possible flash fire_
	- LR, melting point of 228-231\\(^{\circ}\\)C, and is insoluble in water. Very low solubility in any organic solvent except [hexamethylphosphoramide](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fayaz_Larik/publication/311232074_Application_of_Lawesson%27s_reagent_in_the_synthesis_of_sulfur-containing_medicinally_significant_natural_alkaloids/links/59c812c6a6fdccc71923f9ae/Application-of-Lawessons-reagent-in-the-synthesis-of-sulfur-containing-medicinally-significant-natural-alkaloids.pdf). 'Used for thionation of carbonyls and <span style="text-decoration:underline">alcohols</span>'
	- LR also works with amides, using toluene under reflux. (SAME PAPER)
	- Also makes for easy synthesis of thiophene from 1,4-dicarbonyls
- [Conversion of carbonyls to thiocarbonyls](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286011000263)
	- NEED TO CHECK FOR ISOCYANATES SPECIFICALLY
- [Reactivity of isothiocyanate towards alcohols?](http://0-www.tandfonline.com.pugwash.lib.warwick.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/00304949309457933?journalCode=uopp20) \[1 day\]
	- Check reaction **20** of ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate **1b** with dodecanol. 100% yield found, 0.1 mol of both isothiocyanate and alcohol stirred at RT for 12 hours, recystallised in hexane.
- How to test if thionation is successful?
	- IR cf [diiso](http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C822060&Mask=80#IR-Spec), \\(^{13}\\)C NMR to look at C=O
  conversion to C=S, vibrations or chemical shifts. \[2 days, run and get results\]
	- The most significant signals in the \\(^{13}\\)C NMR spectra are those of the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups which usually appeared in the ranges 148-154 and 163-189 ppm.  
- How to isolate the thiourea product? \[read, 1 day, test, 1 day with a small amount of sample\]
- Going back to the original urea-modified material, how do we know we've made
  it?
	- IR, NMR, loss of C=N from isocyanate to carbamate- needs proving. \[2 days\]

## After making the products, testing!

- Need to make thermosets, with covalent PU and modifying the non-covalent sample.
	- Di
	- 5 mol% tri
	- 10 mol% tri
	- Di thio
	- 5 mol% tri thio
	- 10 mol% tri thio
- DMA/tensile testing on all samples, along with birefrigence. \[1 week\]
- Scratch testing on films on of non-covalent samples. \[2 days\]
- Samples on the drop-shape analyser, with birefrigence. \[??? Depends on flow rate\]
